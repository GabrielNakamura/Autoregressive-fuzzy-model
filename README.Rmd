# General overview

This repository contains the data and analysis for the manuscript **Generalized phylogenetic fuzzy weighting: unravelling phylogenetic imprints on species distribution across space**. Generalized phylogenetic fuzzy weighting provides a way to measure the strength of phylogenetic signal in a metacommunity. This project is under development and will be regularly updated.

# Repository structure 

`R` this folder contains one script to run simulation scenarios used to test type-I error rate and statistical power of the method

`functions` this folder contains all functions needed to run the simulation scenarios presented in `D_simulation-scenarios-power-typeI.R`

`output` this folder contains all results from simulation scenarios performed in `D_simulation-scenarios-power-typeI.R`
